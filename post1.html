        <h2>What Are Responsive Search Ads?</h2>
        <p>If you are new to responsive search ads, this is a relatively new ad format Google has introduced which lets
          you create ads with multiple headlines and descriptions (more than 3).</p>
        <figure class="callout">
          <span class="icon">ðŸ’¡</span>
          <p>If you are already familiar with responsive search and want to get some actionable tips, skip to <a
              href="#actionable-tips">this</a> section.</p>
        </figure>
        <p>After you create the ad, Google Ads will test various combinations and learn which combinations perform best.
        </p>
        <p>Here's the example of creating new responsive search ads in the web interface:</p>

          <h2>Why use Responsive Search Ads?</h2>
          <p>You may be wondering whether it's a good idea to trust an algorithm and put your ads on autopilot, but
            with some guidance and common sense, you will be able to produce great ads that drive higher CTR.</p>
          <p>Since their launch, the responsive search ads quickly became a lucrative alternative to standard extended
            text ads, as they help to display more benefits and information in your ads, which, in turn, increases your
            chances of improving your ads' performance.</p>
          <p>Benefits of using responsive search ads include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>flexibility </em>
              (algorithm adapts them to various devices; for example, only 2 headlines will show for users browsing on
              mobile, while desktop users may see 3 headlines);
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>better use of time</em> (instead of continuously testing various headlines and descriptions within one
              ad group, responsive search ads let you create multiple assets across more ad groups)
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>testing </em>(unlike in case of standard expanded text ads, Google will show you the performance of
              each headline and description of your responsive search ads, which makes it easier to test and manage your
              assets)
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>control </em>
              (by specifying headline and description positions you are able to curate which assets are going to be
              displayed no matter what and in what position; the general rule is to specify the position for the
              headline 1 (and include one of your keywords) to improve the Ad Relevance while keeping other assets not
              pinned unless you absolutely have to display it)
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>increase in reach</em>
              (the increased number of headlines and descriptions means you have a higher chance of getting your queries
              marched which allows you to compete in more auctions and improve your reach)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>How many headlines and descriptions should I use?</h2>
          <p>Usually, the more - the better. You can create up to 15
            headlines and 4 descriptions for each ad and you should aim for the higher number. The more assets you
            provide, the higher the chance Google will match your potential customers' search query, which can
            improve the performance of your ads and increase the CTR.</p>
          <p>Of course, it's barely manageable to create 15
            headlines and 4 descriptions for each of the ad variants. Thankfully, you can often get away with 6-8
            headlines and 3 descriptions for most of your ad groups, while top click ones may use more assets to improve
            the rotation of your ads.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Are there ways to create them quickly?</h2>
          <p>While responsive search ads are a powerful tool for any
            paid advertiser, it is easy to waste a lot of time creating unique ads for each ad groups.</p>
          <p>To avoid this, try reusing some of the current headlines
            and descriptions you already have in your campaigns. The combination of old and new headlines and
            descriptions
            is the best way of approaching responsive search ads while minimizing your time.</p>

          <h2>6 actionable tips to supercharge your responsive search ads:</h2>
          <div>
            <h3>
              <mark>
                1. Use unique headlines and descriptions for each of your ads
              </mark>
            </h3>
            <p>In order to help Google test new variations and
              increase the performance of your ads, you should consider coming up with original ideas for your headlines
              and descriptions, instead of simply modifying small parts of existing assets and hoping for the best. </p>
            <p>For example, avoid creating headlines like
              &quot;Enquire now&quot;, &quot;Enquire today&quot;, and &quot;Make an Enquiry&quot; in one ad, as it
              restricts Google's algorithm to deliver relevant combinations. Aside from that, it just looks weird
              and pushy to the person who is looking at your ads. It's always important to think whether you would
              click on the ad you are creating, and the responsive search ads are no exceptions. In fact, it can be even
              trickier, as there's more room to mess this up. The ability to use more than 3 unique headlines and
              descriptions in 1 ad is a powerful ability, but you should always consider how each of the variations is
              going to be displayed in every combination.</p>
            <p>Instead, try focusing on different benefits or areas
              to diversity your ads and improve the learning curve, while making your headlines and descriptions
              different enough. For example, for the law firm you are promoting, you could try using a brand name as a
              pinned headline 1, while creating other headlines such as &quot;Accredited Family Lawyers&quot;,
              &quot;Free Consultation Available&quot; and &quot;Trusted by Over 1500 Clients&quot; as other headlines
              (order does not matter).</p>
            <p>Here are the topics you can experiment with when
              creating unique headlines: </p>
            <figure>
              <a href="/images/rsa-headline-topics.png">
                <img src="/images/rsa-headline-topics.png" alt="examples of topics for RSA" />
              </a>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>
              <mark>
                2. Incorporate popular and high click keywords into your ads
              </mark>
            </h3>
            <p>Just as in case of standard expanded text ads (ETA),
              it makes sense to include your top keywords in both headlines and descriptions of your RSA. Thankfully,
              you have more opportunities to improve your ad relevance than in the case ETA, primarily by including your
              keywords across more headlines and pinning some of them to make sure they are shown no matter what. </p>
            <p>Let's say your top keywords in an ad group are
              &quot;birthday party bristol&quot; and &quot;ideas for birthdays in bristol&quot; - both of these can be
              used in your headlines and descriptions to match the query and improve the ad relevance, which, in turn,
              increases your CTR.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>
              <mark>
                3. Check your ad strength to see if your ad is falling behind
              </mark>
            </h3>
            <p>The ability to see the performance of your assets
              makes it easier for you to identify poor performers and replace them with new assets. Regularly replacing
              your headlines will help you improve the ad relevance and ad rotation. </p>
            <p>To do that, go to the Ads in Google Ads' web
              interface, then click on the &quot;View asset details&quot; at the bottom of your responsive search ad,
              where you will be able to check the performance of each individual headline or description (given that you
              have enough data). Note that according to Google, RSA usually need around 5k impressions over the last 30
              active days to display a rating in the Performance column.</p>
            <p>Additionally, you can check the Combinations column on
              the same page to see which ad combinations are top performing in terms of visibility and the CTR. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>
              <mark>
                4. Take advantage of the campaign experiments
              </mark>
            </h3>
            <p>To improve your testing, consider creating Campaign
              Experiments for your top campaigns/ad groups to test how the control group with responsive search ads
              compares to the campaigns/campaigns that don't have responsive search ads or have fewer such ads.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>
              <mark>
                5. Use RSA along with automated bid strategies
              </mark>
            </h3>
            <p>While RSA can work on manual bidding strategies, the
              best way to leverage this powerful ad format is to trust the algorithm and let Google do the work for you.
            </p>
            <p>Applying strategies such as Target CPA or Maximize
              Conversions for the campaigns that have a high number of responsive search ads will help you improve the
              conversion performance. Note that you will need enough conversion data to fully leverage RSA with
              automated bidding strategies.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>
              <mark>
                6. Implement 2 responsive search ads along with 1 standard extended text ad
              </mark>
            </h3>
            <p>Going all-in on responsive search ads may be a good
              idea, but an even better one would be to diversity your ad groups with at 1 standard extended text ad.
              It's recommended by Google and has shown great results for the clients from different industries,
              ranging from finance, commerce, restaurants and others. Try setting it up for your clients as an
              experiment to see it this holds up for your clients. </p>
          </div>
          <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Responsive search ads provide an exciting opportunity for
              advertisers to get in front of more clients and create versatile ads. They help to showcase more benefits
              while constant rotation helps to identify losing and winning assets quicker than in the case of expanded
              text
              ads. Following the tips above you will be able to give your ads an edge and stand out from the
              competition.
