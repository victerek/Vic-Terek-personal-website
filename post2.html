        <h2>What has recently changed on Facebook Ads?</h2>
        <p>Over the last year, Facebook Ads experienced a drastic change in performance for most of the advertisers. Impacted by the iOS updates and Apple's enforced privacy, advertisers have experienced increases CPCs, higher competition and worse results.</p>
        <p>After you create the ad, Google Ads will test various combinations and learn which combinations perform best.</p>
        <section>
          <h2>Why should you care?</h2>
          <p>Despite the changes, FB still remainds one of the best channels for small and large businesses, offering unique opportunities for the client who are willing to experiment and improve on existing campaigns</p>
        <section class="rsa-tips" id="actionable-tips">
          <h2>7 best practices to survive and thrive on Facebook Ads in 2022:</h2>
          <h3>
            <mark>
              1. Test broader targeting for Remarketing and Acquistion
            </mark>
          </h3>
          <p>Ever since the updates in 2021, it is increasingly important to give Facebook Ads algorithm more data so it can properly optimize for conversions. Using 1% Lookalikes or only one remarketing source (such as website visitors) is no longer enough, as your audience might be smaller than use expect. Here are some of the tips to broaden your audience size while still focusing on relevance:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>create video views remarketing audience</em>
              (it can be beneficial to create a small-budget reach or video views objective campaign and later create an audience for people who interacted with your business's page or viewed the video. Since people have shown interest in your ads, you create a qualified audience of people who views over 10 or 15 seconds of your ad and later remarket to them);
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>higher percentage lookalikes</em> (instead of focusing on 1-2% lookalikes, test higher ranges (such as 3-4%) to feed more data into the algorithm )
            </li>      
            <li>
              <em>broader cold audiences</em> (depending on your industry, it can be extremely helpful to test broader cold audiences, using more loose detailed targeting and increasing the age bracket)
            </li>

          <h3>
            <mark>
              2. Incorporate popular and high click keywords into your ads
            </mark>
          </h3>
          <p>Just as in the case of standard expanded text ads (ETAs),
            it makes sense to include your top keywords in both headlines and descriptions of your responsive search ads. Thankfully,
            you have more opportunities to improve your ad relevance than in the case ETAs, primarily by including your
            keywords across more headlines and pinning some of them to make sure they are being shown</p>
          <p>Let's say your top keywords in an ad group are
            &quot;birthday party bristol&quot; and &quot;ideas for birthdays in bristol&quot; - both of these can be
            used in your headlines and descriptions to match the query and improve the ad relevance, which, in turn,
            increases your CTR.</p>
          <h3>
            <mark>
              3. Check your ad strength to see if the ad is falling behind
            </mark>
          </h3>
          <p>The ability to see the performance of your assets
            makes it easier for you to identify poor performers and replace them with new assets. Regularly replacing
            your headlines will help you improve the ad relevance and ad rotation. </p>
          <p>To do that, go to the Ads in Google Ads' web
            interface, then click on the &quot;View asset details&quot; at the bottom of your responsive search ad,
            where you will be able to check the performance of each individual headline or description (given that you
            have enough data). Note that according to Google, RSAs usually need around 5k impressions over the last 30
            active days to display a rating in the Performance column.</p>
          <p>Additionally, you can check the Combinations column on
            the same page to see which ad combinations are top performing in terms of visibility and the CTR. </p>
          <h3>
            <mark>
              4. Take advantage of the campaign experiments
            </mark>
          </h3>
          <p>To improve your testing, consider creating Campaign
            Experiments for your top campaigns/ad groups to test different responsive search ads, or, for example, try testing RSAs with fewer headlines compared to those with more assets
          </p>
          <h3>
            <mark>
              5. Use RSAs along with automated bid strategies
            </mark>
          </h3>
          <p>While RSA can work on manual bidding strategies, the
            best way to leverage this powerful ad format is to trust the algorithm and let Google do the work for you.
          </p>
          <p>Applying strategies such as Target CPA, Maximize
            Conversions (or a combined version) for the campaigns that have a high number of responsive search ads will help you improve the
            conversion performance. Note that you will need enough conversion data to fully leverage RSA with
            automated bidding strategies.</p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Responsive search ads provide an exciting opportunity for
              advertisers to get in front of more clients and create versatile ads. They help to showcase more benefits
              while constant rotation helps to identify losing and winning assets quicker than in the case of expanded
              text
              ads. Following the tips above you will be able to give your ads an edge and stand out from the
              competition.
